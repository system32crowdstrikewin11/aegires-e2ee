# Aegires E2EE

Encrypt and decrypt Discord messages with a shared passphrase, as a plugin for **Kettu** (Revenge-based) on Android.

Aegires E2EE is built with Kettu as its primary target. Messages are also designed to be readable by people using the native **Aegires Android client**, or an Aliucord plugin that is compatible with it, as long as everyone uses the same key.

This plugin leverages the client-side encryption feature of [Aegires](https://github.com/Curione23/Aegires) by Curione23. See [Credits](#credits).

> **Status: experimental.** Text encryption and decryption work. Image support is currently broken. See [Status](#status) and [Known issues](#known-issues).

## Features

- **Text message encryption and decryption** with a shared password
- **Global key** used in every chat that has no key of its own
- **Per-chat keys**: set a separate password for a specific channel, by channel ID
- **Per-chat on/off switch** for outgoing encryption, so you choose where messages are encrypted
- **Encrypt by default** option for chats without their own setting
- **Lock icon** shown in front of decrypted messages, so you can tell what was encrypted
- **Password is never stored**. Only the key derived from it is kept
- **Built-in diagnostics** showing what the plugin hooks are doing and how many messages were encrypted, decrypted or failed
- **Built-in self-test** that checks Discord has a secure random source and that your phone can decrypt messages made by the real Aegires code
- **Optional debug logging**

## Status

| Feature | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Text encryption / decryption | Working |
| Global key and per-chat keys | Working |
| Per-chat on/off switch | Working |
| Lock icon on decrypted messages | Working |
| Diagnostics and self-test | Working |
| Image encryption / decryption | Broken, in progress |
| Video and other file encryption | Coming soon |
| AES-256 | Coming soon (experimental) |

## Compatibility

| Client | Support |
| --- | --- |
| Kettu (Android) | Primary target |
| [Aegires](https://github.com/Curione23/Aegires) Android client | Can read messages if it uses the same key |
| Aliucord with a compatible plugin | Can read messages if it uses the same key |

Everyone in a conversation must use the **same password**. Messages cannot be decrypted without it.

## Installation

1. Open Kettu and go to its plugin manager.
2. Choose to install a plugin from a URL.
3. Paste this URL, including the trailing slash:

   ```
   https://system32crowdstrikewin11.github.io/aegires-e2ee/dev/
   ```

4. Enable **Aegires E2EE**.

## Usage

1. Open the plugin settings with the wrench icon on the plugin card.
2. Run the **Self-test** first to confirm everything works on your device.
3. Under **Global key**, type the shared password and press **Set global key**.
4. To use a different password in one chat, fill in the **Per-chat key / switch** section with that chat's channel ID and password, then press **Save for this chat**.
5. Turn on **Encrypt outgoing here** for chats where you want your messages encrypted, or enable **Encrypt outgoing messages by default**.

Leave the password empty in the per-chat section if you only want to change that chat's on/off setting.

If something isn't working, press **Refresh** in the Diagnostics section after sending or receiving a message to see what the plugin is doing.

## Known issues

- Image encryption and decryption are currently broken.
- Video and other file attachments are not supported yet.

Please open an issue if you find something else. Turn on debug logging and include the Diagnostics output if you can.

## Roadmap

- Fix image encryption and decryption
- Video and other file encryption
- AES-256 as an experimental option

## Building from source

Requires Node.js and npm.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/system32crowdstrikewin11/aegires-e2ee.git
cd aegires-e2ee
npm install
npm run build
```

The build writes `index.js` and `manifest.json` to `dist/`. Host those two files on any static host (for example GitHub Pages) and install the folder's URL in Kettu.

## Security notes

- This is an experimental hobby project. Do not rely on it where failure would be serious.
- Encryption covers message content only. Discord can still see who is talking to whom, in which channel, and when.
- Anyone who has the password can read the messages. Share it through a channel you trust, not through the encrypted chat itself.
